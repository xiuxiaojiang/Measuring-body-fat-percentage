# Data Analyst for Body Fat: Measuring body fat percentage

Knowing body fat percentage is important for evaluating overall health, but it's not always convenient to go to a clinic or hospital. The project aims to find an easier way to measure body fat percentage, which is important for evaluating overall health and reducing the risk of diseases associated with high body fat percentage.

Model: Linear regression and ridge regression

Results: Linear regression model is a better model than ridge regression model. We can predict the body fat percentage by the size of abdomen, wrist, weight, biceps and height using linear regression model.
